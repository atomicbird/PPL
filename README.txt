Warning: These PPL sources are obsolete and unsupported.

    You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without
    restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the
    responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are
    not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "Apple Sample Code"
    after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,
    we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was
    descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.The use
    of the software is also governed by the software license agreement
    included in the ReadMe file.


These are the sources to the NSPPL class from Foundation, the ppl command-line tool, and NSPPL documentation.  The PPL.fproj subproject will produce a PPL.framework, and the ppl.tproj produces the ppl tool.  See PPL.html for the documentation.

These sources are as they came from Foundation, and the only changes have been to eliminate the "NS" prefix on global symbols.  (And yes, there really was one big source file containing all of the NSPPL classes.)

There are no known bugs outstanding against PPL.
